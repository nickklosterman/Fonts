A TrueType font created by Christian Thalmann (cinga at gmx dot
net).  Distribute and use freely, but not without this readme file.
If you should use it for a poster campaign, flyer, invitation or
something, I'd appreciate it if you'd send me an e-mail about it.
I like to see my work put to use.  =)

This particular font is more complex to use than my usual ones.  
Every letter has an initial, medial and final form so as to allow
fluent words with nice beginnings and ends.  Some letters have even
more forms for special situations.  Finally, there are a bunch of 
accents and word primers/terminators for decoration.

The keyboard setup is extremely simple to learn on a Mac.  Just
switch to the American keyboard setting, and all medial letter 
forms will lie on lowercase letter keys, all initial ones on 
uppercase keys, and all final ones on ALT+letter keys.  The German
umlauted letters are found in their standard positions on the
German or Swiss German keyboard setting, i.e. on the ' ; [ keys of
the American keyboard.  A more complete inventory follows below.

On a PC, you might need to use an ASCII table or Unicode commands
to type.  Or then somebody could write up a nice Java program to
convert text into the fitting code?  Not my job, anyway.  :o)

IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT SIMPLE, you can restrict yourself to 
initial (uppercase) and medial (lowercase) letters, using the
handy terminators (on the grave accent key, ie the grave accent
and ASCII tilde characters) to cap off any trailing connecting
base line.  This should be easy enough to do even on a PC.
