This is the true type version of the Pompeii Caps font, a caps-only calligraphy font, based on wall writing found in ancient Pompeii.  Looks best in larger point sizes.  

This font is (c) 1993 by J. Fordyce but may be freely distributed provided it is not altered, no fee is charged for it, and this text file is included with it.
