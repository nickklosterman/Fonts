The computer font Pop-Ups was created 
by Harold Lohner, 1998, and placed into 
the public domain by him.

Pop-Ups is based on an analog reproduction 
of an unnamed "Art Deco" font.

The lowercase are half-size, centered caps.  
Check your key map for single-stroke 
marquee words like THE and WITH.

Let me know what you do with this!
