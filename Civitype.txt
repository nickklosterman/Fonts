Civitype FG

The font Civitype comes with Fontographer 4.1. AFAIK it
is based on a script font named "Civilité".
The font database file says:

"Developed by S. G. Moye 1991. Public Domain."

So I had no scruples creating my own version. Many of
the alternative characters in this font went to places
where they are accessible under Windows. The germandbls
was created new, the s with flourish went to }. The d
was problematic when proceeded by an l, like in wild,
build, folder etc. I adjusted it and placed the original
on Ú. There is another alternative d on the backslash.
Use a character map to find what you need. Mind the ch
and ck ligatures on Ì and Í.

I only added lowercase international characters mostly
since you won't use such a font all-caps anyway.

This version is freeware but not in the public domain
any more. Use it for any purpose and at your own risk,
pass it on as long as you do it for free, but if you
want to make your own version from it ask me first or
use Steven Moye's PD version to start.
