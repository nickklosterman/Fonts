"Big Ten Mania" is special dingbat font from Rich Gast.

NOTICE: THE IMAGES USED TO MAKE THIS FONT ARE UNDOUBTEDLY COPYRIGHTED
BY THE BIG TEN CONFERENCE AND/OR THE INDIVIDUAL UNIVERSITIES BELONGING

It was originally created on 12/10/98.

Version 3.0 was completed on 8/01/99. This version both updates the
copyright information from DarkSide Productions to GreyWolf WebWorks
and makes the font embeddable.

############ EMBEDDABLE FONTS ############
NOTE: This font is coded so that it can be embedded in MS Word (.DOC)
documents. Thus, if you use this font in an MS Word document and save
the document with the font embedded, the recipient of the document will
see it with this font even though they may not have the font loaded on
their system. To embed a font in an MS Word document select "Tools"
from the MS Word menu bar and then select "Options". Under the "Save"
tab, check the box marked "Embed True Type fonts".  VOILA !
(The recipient must open the document in MS Word for this to work.)

NOTE TO PERSONAL USERS: Maybe, just maybe, you'll make a fortune using
this font in some manner. If you do, all I ask is that you remember me
with a token of your appreciation. Any modest amount (at least $1 and
not to exceed $1,000,000) would be an appropriate gesture for my
contribution to your monumental financial success. Hey! I can dream!

If you don't like the selection, or lack thereof, of dingbats for your
favorite university, don't bitch at me. I begged for contributions on
various Big Ten fan forums as well as in the alt.binaries.fonts news
group. You had your chance!

Oh, yeah....I almost forgot. If (for some unknown reason) you really
do want to make a donation to encourage me to continue my creative
efforts, send it to the address above. (Yeah....As If!) Thanks & Enjoy!
